# SQL Architecture Harness

Use this when code shape matters more than the feature.

## Rules

- One module, one job.
- Entry functions should orchestrate, not do everything.
- Keep pure logic away from IO, UI, and global state.
- Split by responsibility, not by line count.
- Turn repeated guards into a shared helper or state module.
- Keep wrappers thin until callers move.
- Avoid another `if` inside already complex code.

## Pattern

1. Find the stable seam.
2. Extract the pure part first.
3. Move one branch or call site.
4. Keep the old entry as a wrapper.
5. Add/update a regression test.
6. Remove the wrapper when callers migrate.

## Smells

- Deep nested `if` / `elseif`.
- UI + command execution + state mutation in one file.
- Repeated `D.T()` / guard checks.
- Large top-to-bottom functions.

## Use the house primitives — do not re-roll them

These seams exist; new code goes through them, and migration candidates
are noted rather than re-implemented:

- Floating windows: `float_window.open()` / `open_centered()` — never
  hand-roll `nvim_open_win` + title-fallback + q/Esc + WinLeave again.
- db_browser highlights: `db_browser/theme.register()` — never hand-roll
  nvim_set_hl + apply_highlight_overrides + ColorScheme autocmd.
- Lazy `poste introspect` fetches (completion): `start_introspect_job` in
  `completion/data.lua` — in-flight dedupe, queued callbacks, epoch guard
  live there.
- db_browser tree refresh: `db_browser/util.refresh_subtree` /
  `render_tree` — the expand/refresh dance has one implementation.
- Identifier quoting: `ident.quote` / `quote_literal`.
- Response handling for SQL execution: `sql_runner/response.lua`.

An external UI framework (nui-components) was evaluated and rejected for
now — see `docs/dev/sql/architecture-review.md` §3 before reconsidering.
Extending the in-house primitives is the default move.

## Know when NOT to unify

- A "dual source of truth" with correct, covering sync points is a
  contained duality, not a smell. Map every writer/reader before proposing
  a unification; if sync covers all writers, recommend won't-do with
  evidence.
- UX-visible framework migrations (retiring `forms.lua`, swapping dialog
  frameworks) change what users see. Headless plenary suites do not cover
  focus, editing, or keyboard flows. Defer with a documented migration
  path and require a real-session verification step — do not ship
  unverifiable UI changes to make a refactor "complete".
